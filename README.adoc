= XML Parser

A basic parser for XML which includes support for:
element name, closing tags, nesting, attributes (without the "").

```xml
<form>
    <input width=10 height=5 />
</form>
```


== Testing

You can find the unit tests in the ``src/tests.rs``.


== Credits

This project was inspired by https://bodil.lol/parser-combinators/.
However, I found the implementation convoluted so I tried writing my own
version.
